# LearnTables
Programs to learn, listen and test multiplication tables from 2 to 9.

# How to use
Download this repository. You will find two python files and a folder containing audio files. You can double-click to directly open the program. Enter either a single table or multiple tables using space. For example: `6 7 8`.

Use **tables_read.py** to passively learn tables by listening to them. There is a user-defined pause before the answer, which gives you time to guess. The **tables_test.py** program helps to actively test your tables.

You need **pygame** module to play audio. `pip install pygame`
